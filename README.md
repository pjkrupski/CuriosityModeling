CS1710GroupProject

Goal:
The goal for this project is to model a four way traffic light with bi-directional cross walks and the potential of pedestrian traffic. The predicates in the model ensure that no traffic will be unsafely intersecting each otherâ€™s path and that pedestrians will enjoy a right of way when their cross walk has a white light.


Rules:
Vehicles may not go through red lights however may make a right on red if the adjacent cross walk is unoccupied. In the case of a yellow light, vehicles may or may not proceed based on their stopping distance. The following are the parameters set for the four listed vehicle types

-Car: Must stop at yellow light if speed is under 7
-Truck: Must stop at yellow light if speed is under 6
-Van: Must stop at yellow light if speed is under 5
-Bus: Must stop at yellow light if speed is under 4



Specifications:
The specifications to build out elements of this model in forge were completed as follows  

sig car:
-  speed type: Int 
-  model (bus, truck, car, van) ex. one sig Bus extends Model {}
-  start direction (north, south, east, west) ex. one sig North extends Direction {}
-  end direction (north, south, east, west)
-  start position (Near or Far)
-  end position (Near or Far)

sig light:
-  direction one sig North extends Direction {}
-  mainLight: Color (red, yellow, green) ex. one sig Red extends Color {}
-  leftArrow: Color
-  rightArrow: Color

sig crosswalk:
-  color (white, red)
-  forwardDirection
-  reverseDirection
-  occupied: Boolean

rules: 
- car can cross when light is green or can cross yellow if speed is above 50
- can turn when arrow is green/yellow, or on red and crosswalk occupied is false, when changing direction paths, and crosswalk occupied is false
- cannot turn in any other case
- type bus and truck cannot turn on red, spead threshold is lower for crossing yellow lights



Edge cases: 
After testing this model we discovered multiple scenarios that were being aloud that we had not initially thought of. For cases such as this we tried to stay as close as possible to how things work in an actual traffic light. Some examples are
A vehicle can make a U-turn and proceed in the opposite direction
A vehicle can chose not to go when the light turns green 




Expectations in Sterling:
//Traces
run {
     wellformedVehicle
     wellformedLight
     wellformedCrosswalk
     canCross
 } for exactly 5 State, exactly 5 Vehicle, exactly 4 Light, exactly 2 Crosswalk
   for {next is linear}
   
   
   
   
Improvements:
If we were to expand on this model, we would enforce further restrictions that would represent more realities that are present in real life traffic lights. These could include factors such as
Bus may not make right on red
Stopping distance for yellow light is decreased under inclement weather
Pedestrians may occupy a red lit cross walk if no cars are present
